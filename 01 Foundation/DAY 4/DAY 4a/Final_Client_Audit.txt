As a Senior Auditor, I will analyze the given numbers to determine the total deficit.

Total Income (Revenue + Other Income): $1000
Subtractions:

1. Taxes: $200
2. Rent: $500
3. Salary: $400

Now, let's calculate the total deficits:

1. Taxes: -$200
2. Rent: -$500
3. Salary: -$400

Total Deficit = Taxes + Rent + Salary
= -200 + (-500) + (-400)
= -$1100

The company has a total deficit of $1100.

Note that this calculation assumes that the expenses are solely deducted from the revenue and other income. In reality, additional expenses such as debt repayment, interest payments, etc., may also be included in the total deficit.
