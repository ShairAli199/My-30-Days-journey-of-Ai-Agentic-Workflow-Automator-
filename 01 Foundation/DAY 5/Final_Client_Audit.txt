As a Senior Auditor, I will analyze the given numbers to determine the total deficit.

To calculate the deficit, we need to subtract the expenses from the revenue:

Revenue: $1,000
Expenses:
- Tax: $200
- Rent: $500
- Salary: $400
Total Expenses: $200 + $500 + $400 = $1,100

Deficit = Total Expenses - Revenue
= $1,100 - $1,000
= -$100

The total deficit is $100.
